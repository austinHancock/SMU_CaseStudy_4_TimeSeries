# SMU_CaseStudy_4_TimeSeries (Python)

Case study for MS Data Science.
Work done in collaboration with Kevin Cannon.

Use historical stock price data in python to analyze time series data with ARIMAS. Estimate ARIMAS model parameters (p,d,q) using autocorrelation functions and rule-based decision making, and compare the results to a grid search for the parameters.
